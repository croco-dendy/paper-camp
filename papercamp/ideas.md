Paper Camp
A local-first, AI-native project companion that lives where your work lives.

Most project management tools are built around teams, dashboards, and the assumption that your work needs to be somewhere on the internet. Paper Camp rejects that. It lives in your repository, versioned alongside your code, invisible to everything except you and your AI assistant.
The core idea is simple: every project deserves a memory. Not a kanban board, not a ticket system — a structured, honest record of where you started, where you are, and where you're going. A place where ideas don't get lost in chat history or sticky notes. A place your AI can read in seconds and immediately understand the current state of your intent.

The folder is the database.
A papercamp/ directory sits at the root of your project. It contains markdown files with a defined structure — ideas, plans, progress, decisions, open questions. No external services, no sync, no accounts. Every change is a git commit. The history of your project is the history of those files.

AI as a first-class collaborator.
Paper Camp is designed around the way humans actually work with AI assistants. At the start of every session, you point your assistant to papercamp/ and it knows everything — what was built, what was decided, what's next. No re-explaining. No lost context. The structured files are not documentation written after the fact; they are the living source of truth that both you and the AI maintain together.

Planting seeds, not filling templates.
New projects don't start from static boilerplate. They start from intent. You describe what you want to build — a single high-level idea — and the system scaffolds the initial papercamp/ structure around that intent. The AI initializes the infrastructure based on your blueprint, not a generic template. Every project begins with its own logic, not someone else's defaults.

The interface is analog by choice.
When you run papercamp in your terminal, a local web interface opens — built with Paper UI, styled like a retro creative dashboard. Analog gauges display project health and momentum. Focus toggles let you isolate a single task and feed it cleanly to your AI without noise. It feels like a creative studio tool, not enterprise software.

It grows with you.
Paper Camp doesn't tell you how to manage your project. It gives you a structure minimal enough to stay out of the way and rich enough to be genuinely useful. Over time, the papercamp/ folder becomes an artifact — a honest, chronological record of how something was made, decision by decision, idea by idea.

Built for makers who work alone, think in systems, and use AI as a creative partner — not a shortcut.

### IDEA-1: Project docs browser

A Docs page that aggregates all project documentation into a browsable, searchable view inside the dashboard, so the project's full narrative — structure, conventions, decisions — is one click away instead of scattered across the terminal and editor. The papercamp/ folder is the living memory; the Docs page is the reference library built on top of it.

The most concrete, lowest-effort slice of this already half-exists: `parseDecisions` and `parseOpenQuestions` (`src/core/parser.ts`) and the `/api/decisions`/`/api/open-questions`/`/api/progress` routes (`src/app/server/api.ts`) are fully built and tested, but no page in the dashboard fetches them — they're dead endpoints right now. A Docs page is the natural home for the UI that's been missing all along.

Feature ideas, roughly in build order:

- **Decisions log view** — render `decisions.md` as a real list of ADRs: title, `Stamp` for `decided`/`superseded`, date, and the prose body (Context/Decision/Rationale). A `superseded` entry links forward to whatever replaced it via `Superseded-by`.
- **Open questions view** — render `open-questions.md` the same way: `Stamp` for `open`/`resolved`, and a `resolved`-entry links to the `decisions.md` entry that answered it via `Resolved-by`. Open questions are the most actionable thing in `papercamp/` that currently has zero visibility outside the raw file.
- **Cross-linking between the two** — since a decision's "Resolved-by" and a question's "Resolved-by" already reference each other by title, turn those into real in-app links (click a resolved question, land on the deciding decision, and vice versa) instead of just rendering the prose.
- **Progress timeline** — a simple reverse-chronological feed of `progress.md`'s `## YYYY-MM-DD` sections. Could stand alone, or merge with decision dates into one combined "project history" feed.
- **Repo docs section** — a second grouping, separate from the structured `papercamp/` records above, for the general markdown floating around the repo root (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`) and any others that show up later (e.g. a `docs/` folder, `CONTRIBUTING.md`). Plain markdown rendering, no parsing into fields — same "read-only, no schema" treatment `ideas.md` already gets.
- **Search** — one search box, full-text across everything above (decisions, open questions, progress entries, repo docs), jumping straight to the matching section.
- **Navigation** — a left sidebar grouped by source ("Decisions", "Open Questions", "Progress", "Repo Docs"), same shape as the existing `PlansSidebar`.

Why this one first: the backend is already done and tested. This is UI work on top of an existing, working API surface, not a new subsystem.

### IDEA-2: Settings page with sidebar and editable configs

Turn Settings from a single static info+icon page into a real sidebar-driven configuration workspace — but scoped honestly to what *this* repo's stack actually has, not a generic eslint/prettier list. The existing project-info card (name, version, icon — already built) becomes the sidebar's default "General" section rather than the whole page.

Feature ideas:

- **Sidebar layout** — mirror `PlansSidebar`'s structure: a left rail of sections, main area showing whichever one is selected. "General" (current project-info card) is the default landing section.
- **Auto-discovered config sections, not a hardcoded list** — a new `GET /api/configs` route that scans the repo root for config files that *actually exist* (this repo today: `biome.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `vite.config.ts`, `vite.app.config.ts`, `postcss.config.js`, `package.json`) and returns only those. Keeps the feature honest as the stack changes, instead of a stale list baked into the UI.
- **Editable raw contents per config** — selecting a config loads its text in an editor area (even a plain `<textarea>` to start; a lightweight syntax highlighter for JSON/TS is a nice-to-have later) with a Save button.
- **Validate before writing** — for JSON-shaped files (`biome.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`) parse and reject invalid JSON before it touches disk, surfaced as an inline `Alert`. Never let a typo corrupt a config file silently.
- **Write-path security boundary** — the save endpoint must only accept filenames from the same allowlisted scan as the read side, never an arbitrary path. This is a local-only dev tool, but a write endpoint that takes any path is still worth avoiding on principle.
- **Editable project identity** — make the existing "General" card's project name field actually editable (it's read-only today), writing back to `.paper-camp/config.json` — pairs naturally with the icon upload that's already shipped.

Why this one second: it needs a new write path (with real validation/security thought, unlike the read-only Docs idea above), so it's more work and slightly more risk — better attempted once the Docs page's read-only pattern is proven out.

### IDEA-3: The Stack — right-side status & history panel

A persistent right-hand panel, present across every page (not a route — more like the `NavigationIsland`, but docked right and full-height), showing the active plan and a feed of recent project activity. Default open, toggleable closed.

**Look:** styled directly after paper-ui's showcase `DetailSidebar` (`src/showcase/components/detail-sidebar.tsx` in the `paper-ui` sibling repo) — the closest existing thing to "chalkboard style, full height" already built. Concretely: `position: fixed`, pinned `right`, `top: 0` to `bottom: 0`, slides in/out via `transform: translateX(...)` with a transition (not a width animation), dark chalkboard texture (`textures.ts`'s `chalkboard` — `#142e22` base + turbulence, paired with the desk-green gradient the showcase panel uses), a `Luminari`-font header with a close/toggle control, and `Caveat`-cursive uppercase labels for each content section. `Card`, `Stamp`, and `CodeBlock` all already support a `variant="chalkboard"` — log entries and status badges inside the panel should use those directly rather than inventing new dark-mode styling.

**Feature ideas, roughly in build order:**

- **Idle state — activity history** — when nothing's in progress, show a reverse-chronological log. The data already exists and is unused: `progress.md` + `/api/progress` (parsed, tested, zero consumers today — same gap the Docs page idea found). Could share a "progress feed" component with the Docs page's progress timeline, just rendered once in light theme (Docs) and once in chalkboard (here).
- **Active state — "what's in progress now"** — surface the currently in-progress plan, reusing the same `findFocusPlan` resolution logic Focus already has, plus its phase progress.
- **Live activity feed, sourced from file changes** — the honest signal for "what's happening" beyond static plan status is changes to the `papercamp/` files themselves. A file watcher (`fs.watch` or `chokidar`) on the dev server, diffing each file's previously-parsed entries against the newly-parsed ones, can synthesize human-readable lines ("phase 2/5 checked off in 'X'", "plan 'Y' marked done", "new open question raised") without inventing a new schema — it's narrating diffs of files that are already the source of truth.
- **Delivery mechanism** — the dev server is currently a plain `node:http` server with only request/response, no push. An SSE endpoint (`GET /api/activity/stream`, kept open, one event per detected change) is the smallest real-time addition Node's `http` module supports natively, no new dependency. Polling `/api/progress`/`/api/plans` on an interval and diffing client-side is the fallback if SSE turns out to be more plumbing than it's worth for a first version.

This whole idea is buildable from data and patterns that already exist in the codebase — no new concept of "an agent" required, just a live view of the same plan/progress state the rest of the dashboard already shows.

---

### IDEA-4: Agent orchestration — launch, watch, and steer tasks from the dashboard

A more concrete shape for what started as "agent observability." Clicking a plan/task in the dashboard launches a real agent session scoped to that task, streams a simplified view of its progress into the status panel ("The Stack" idea above), and lets you send follow-up input into the same session without leaving the browser. This turns Paper Camp from a passive viewer of `papercamp/` into an active layer between you and the agent — but the persisted record stays exactly where it already lives, in `plans.md`/`progress.md`, written by the agent itself as part of doing the work, not in some new log format.

Built for more than one agent from the start — Claude Code for most work, something lighter like opencode for small tasks — rather than hardwiring to one tool and bolting on a second later.

**The core mechanism, roughly in build order:**

- **Launch, through a thin per-agent adapter** — a "Start" action hands the task's prompt to whichever agent is selected, through a small shared interface: `launch(prompt, options) → stream of events`, `resume(sessionId, message) → stream`, plus capability flags (e.g. `supportsResume`). A Claude Code adapter would spawn `claude -p "<prompt>" --output-format stream-json` (or use the Claude Agent SDK directly, if CLI-output parsing turns out too brittle); an opencode adapter does the equivalent against its own CLI/API. Each adapter's only job is normalizing its agent's output into the same event shape — the orchestration logic, status-collapsing, and UI underneath don't know or care which agent is running. The prompt itself is built the same way the existing Focus page's "copy AI handoff prompt" button already constructs its text — this is the natural next step for that feature, not a new one.
- **Choosing an agent** — a default lives in `.paper-camp/config.json` (machine config, not project narrative — the same file that already holds the icon and project name), with an optional per-task override via a new `Agent:` field on a `plans.md` entry, following the same pattern as the existing optional `Tags`/`Updated` fields. That override is exactly the workflow described: route small or routine tasks to a lighter/cheaper agent while keeping bigger work on the default. The Settings idea's sidebar (once built) is the natural place to set the project default.
- **System-prompt instruction instead of a new schema** — whichever agent is launched is told, as part of its prompt, to keep doing what any session in this project already would: append meaningful checkpoints to `progress.md`, check off tasks in `plans.md` as they're done. This is what resolves the file-diff-vs-dedicated-log tension from the previous version of this idea — the agent's own writes *are* the activity log, in the schema that already exists. No second source of truth, and it holds regardless of which agent wrote it.
- **Live status, kept ephemeral** — the raw stream of tool-use events (Read/Edit/Bash/etc.) gets collapsed server-side into one-line, human-readable status text ("Editing `src/foo.ts`", "Running `pnpm test`", "Reading codebase…") and pushed to the status panel over the same SSE channel "The Stack" idea already proposed. Shown only while a task is running, never written to disk — "something's happening and roughly what," not a transcript.
- **Steering mid-task** — for agents whose adapter supports it (Claude Code does, via `--resume`/`--continue`), the dashboard holds onto the running task's session id, and anything typed into the panel's input gets sent as a new turn into that same session rather than starting a new one. This is the part that actually makes it "a layer between you and the agent," not just a fire-and-forget launcher.
- **Completion** — when the process exits, the panel returns to its idle/history state, now showing the fresh `progress.md` entries the session itself just wrote.

**Decisions worth making explicit before this gets scoped into a plan, not discovered mid-build:**

- **Verify each agent's adapter against the real thing before writing it — don't assume Claude Code's specifics generalize.** Its headless `stream-json` output shape and `--resume`/`--continue` session semantics are known; opencode's equivalent scriptable/headless invocation, output format, and whether it supports resuming a session at all still need to be checked against its actual current CLI/API, not assumed by analogy.
- **Capability flags, not silent failure.** If an agent's adapter can't support mid-task resume (or any other capability), the dashboard should visibly disable that control for sessions on that agent rather than pretend it works.
- **One active task at a time for v1, regardless of agent.** Concurrent tasks means a shared workspace with possibly conflicting edits — a much bigger problem than the launch/steer loop itself, not worth solving before that loop works for a single agent.
- **Process lifecycle is independent of the browser tab.** A running agent is a real, possibly long, shell-capable process — it should keep running if the dashboard tab closes; the SSE stream is just a subscription to it, not what keeps it alive.
- **Strictly localhost.** A button that launches a shell-capable agent session is one of the more sensitive things a local tool can expose, whichever agent it is. Fine with no auth bound to `127.0.0.1` (same trust model as running any of these CLIs directly), but this is the one feature that should never grow a "remote access" option without real auth behind it.
- **Uses whichever agent's session/quota is selected** — worth surfacing in the UI somewhere obvious, since each launched task is real usage against that agent's own plan/credits, same as running it manually.

### IDEA-5: Repo health status — live lint/format/test results in The Stack

A third section in the already-built Stack panel (`src/app/components/stack-panel.tsx`), next to "Active" and "Live", showing whether the repo is actually green right now — lint, format, and tests — without opening a terminal. This is the concrete version of a promise the original pitch already made ("analog gauges display project health and momentum") rather than a new concept: three small status pills wired to checks the project already runs by hand.

No new tooling — it wraps the scripts already in `package.json`: `biome check .` (covers both lint and format in one pass, since this repo uses Biome instead of separate ESLint/Prettier) and `vitest run` for tests.

**Look:** a "Status" section using the panel's existing `sectionLabelStyle`, placed at the very top of the panel, above "Active" — it's the most "at a glance" of the panel's sections. (The "Commit section in The Stack" idea below adds a second top-of-panel section; final top-to-bottom order ends up Status → Commit → Active → Live.) Three `Stamp` pills (`variant="chalkboard"`, same component already used elsewhere in the panel/showcase), labeled "Lint", "Format", "Tests", each in one of four states: `pass` (green), `fail` (red), `running` (amber, pulsing), `stale`/`unknown` (gray — shown before the first check has ever run). Clicking a `fail` pill expands a `CodeBlock` (`variant="chalkboard"`) inline beneath it with the raw error output — biome's own error list for lint/format, vitest's failed-test summary for tests — so the failure detail lives in the same panel, no tab-switching to a terminal.

**Feature ideas, roughly in build order:**

- **Backend status cache** — a small in-memory store on the dev server (sits next to `createActivityManager` in `src/app/server/activity.ts`, or a sibling module) holding `{ lint: CheckResult, format: CheckResult, test: CheckResult }`, where `CheckResult` is `{ status: 'pass' | 'fail' | 'running' | 'stale', lastRun: string | null, output: string }`. Starts as all `stale` on server boot.
- **`GET /api/status`** — new route in `src/app/server/api.ts` returning the current cache as-is (no run triggered), same shape as the other read routes (`/api/plans`, `/api/progress`, etc.).
- **Lint/format — auto, on file change** — `biome check .` is near-instant, so it's safe to run on every relevant file change. Reuses whatever file watcher the existing "Live activity feed" item (see "The Stack" idea above) ends up using for `papercamp/` — extend it to also watch `src/`, debounced ~500ms, and spawn `biome check .` on settle. Push the result as a new SSE event type over the *existing* `/api/activity/stream` channel (`activity.ts` already has the pub/sub; this just adds a second event shape, not a second stream) instead of building a parallel connection.
- **Tests — manual first, auto later if it proves worth it** — `vitest run` is too slow/costly to fire on every keystroke. Start with a "Run tests" button inside the Status section (`POST /api/status/test`, triggers a one-off `vitest run`, streams `running` → `pass`/`fail` over the same SSE channel). Only graduate to auto-run (e.g. on a longer debounce, or cached by a hash of `src/**`/`tests/**` so unchanged code skips a re-run entirely) once the manual version shows people actually want it live.
- **In-flight guard** — track a single boolean per check ("lint/format running" / "test running") so a burst of file saves can't spawn overlapping `biome`/`vitest` child processes; a change that arrives mid-run just queues one more run after the current one finishes, instead of stacking processes.
- **Strictly localhost, repo-root-only** — same trust note as the "Agent orchestration" idea above: this spawns real child processes (`biome`, `vitest`), always against the fixed project root the dev server already knows, never a user-supplied path. Fine for a tool that only binds to `127.0.0.1`, but worth keeping explicit as the one boundary not to relax.

Why this is a natural next step rather than a new subsystem: it's the same SSE plumbing the Stack panel's activity feed already needs, pointed at `biome`/`vitest` exit codes instead of `papercamp/` file diffs — no new infrastructure, just a second source feeding the same pipe.

### IDEA-6: Plan & phase IDs — short titles, numbered phases, and a paper-ui accordion for full detail

Right now a `PlanEntry`'s `title` (`src/types/index.ts`) doubles as both the identifier and the full description — entries like "Build core library: parser, schemas, scaffold, CLI" or "Add board view, plan CRUD, and project branding" are sentence-length, and every place that lists plans (`plan-card.tsx`, `plan-nav-item.tsx`, `kanban-card.tsx`, `plans-sidebar.tsx`) renders that whole sentence. Same problem one level down: a `PhaseItem` (`src/types/index.ts`) is just `{ done, text }`, and `text` is itself a full sentence ("Add AI focus handoff — one-line copy-prompt per phase with plan title and phase number") rendered inline in `plan-detail.tsx` with no way to collapse it. This idea gives both plans and phases a short, scannable identity, with the long version still available but tucked behind a click.

**ID scheme:**

- Every plan gets a permanent ID of the form `<TYPE>-<N>` — `FEAT-2`, `FIX-9`, `CHORE-3` — assigned once at creation and never reused, even if the plan is later deleted. `TYPE` is the uppercased `Kind` field on the plan entry, and `Kind`'s values are spelled exactly like Conventional Commits' own type strings (`feat | fix | chore | docs | refactor`, not "feature") — on purpose, so the ID prefix, the `Kind` field, and the commit `type:` that closes it out are the same word in three places, not three near-matching spellings.
- **Numbering must be a persistent counter, not "scan plans.md and take the highest + 1."** Plans get deleted (there's already a `DELETE /api/plans` route), and a scan-based scheme would silently reassign a freed number to a new, unrelated plan — which breaks the entire point of an ID meant to be searchable in git history. Store `nextId: { feat: number, fix: number, ... }` in `.paper-camp/config.json` (the same file that already holds the icon and project name) and increment it server-side on every plan creation, never derive it from the current file contents.
- Ideas get the same treatment, one level up: `IDEA-N`, assigned in the order they're written into `ideas.md`, rendered as a heading prefix (`### IDEA-9: Plan & phase IDs — ...`, this very entry would be the next number). This is what makes a plan → idea backlink (next point) possible — without a stable idea ID, "this plan came from that idea" has nothing durable to point at.
- A plan entry gains an optional `**Idea:** IDEA-9` field (same pattern as the existing optional `Tags`/`Updated` fields in `src/core/parser.ts`/`serializer.ts`), rendered in the UI as a small clickable badge next to the plan's ID that jumps to the originating section of the Docs page's ideas view (see the "Project docs browser" idea above) or `ideas.md` itself. Not every plan needs one — plenty of past entries here (e.g. "Refresh about.md technical reference") were never an idea first.

**Short titles, long bodies:**

- The `title` field becomes a true short headline (2–6 words: "Parser & CLI scaffold" instead of "Build core library: parser, schemas, scaffold, CLI"). Anything lost from the old long-form title moves into the existing `body` field, which already exists separately from `title` and already holds a paragraph of context for most entries — this is a rewording pass on existing data, not a new field.
- Everywhere a plan is listed, render `<Stamp>{id}</Stamp> {shortTitle}` instead of the bare long title — sidebar, board columns, cards, and the `plan-detail.tsx` header.

**Phase numbering + accordion:**

- Phase number is computed, not stored — just `index + 1` over `plan.phases`, so phases always renumber correctly when one is added, removed, or reordered. No markdown change needed for this part.
- `PhaseItem` gains an optional `description?: string` alongside the existing `text` (renamed to read as the short title). Markdown encoding: the checkbox line stays exactly as today (`- [x] Short phase title`), and an optional indented paragraph on the following line(s) becomes the long description:
  ```
  - [x] Parser with non-fatal warnings
        Handles malformed `### Phases` blocks without throwing — collects a ParseWarning
        instead, so one bad entry doesn't take down parsing for the whole file.
  ```
  `extractPhases` in `src/core/parser.ts` needs to grab indented continuation lines following a checkbox item and join them into `description`, leaving phases with no continuation exactly as they parse today (`description: undefined`) — fully backward-compatible with every phase already written in `papercamp/plans.md`.
  - **A paper-ui `Accordion` component, which doesn't exist yet** (checked `~/dev/paper-ui/src/components` — there's `card`, `code-block`, `tabs`, etc., but no expand/collapse primitive). Needs building first: single-item expand/collapse, chevron or `+`/`–` affordance, height-animated via the same `framer-motion` pattern already used in `stack-panel.tsx`'s `AnimatePresence`, with the usual `variant`/`size` props so it slots into both the light Plans page and a future chalkboard context. In `plan-detail.tsx`, each phase row only gets the accordion's expand control if `description` is present — phases with just a short title (the common case for everything written before this lands) render exactly as they do today, no empty disclosure arrow.

**Commitlint alignment:**

- There's no commitlint/husky setup in this repo today (checked `package.json`, no `@commitlint/*` deps, no `.husky/`). Add `@commitlint/cli` + `@commitlint/config-conventional`, enforcing the same `feat|fix|chore|docs|refactor|...` type vocabulary the plan `Kind` field uses — so a plan's ID and the commit type that closes it are the same word, not two parallel taxonomies that can drift apart.
- Nice-to-have, not required for v1: a custom commitlint rule (or just a convention, enforced by habit/AI prompt rather than tooling) nudging commit messages to include a `Refs: FEAT-2` footer line, so `git log --grep "FEAT-2"` finds every commit tied to a given plan — the actual payoff the user is after ("a ready-made number to search the history by").

**Decisions worth making explicit:**

- **IDs are permanent — deleting a plan retires its number, it does not free it.** This is the one correctness property the whole scheme depends on; get the counter-storage decision above wrong and IDs stop being trustworthy as a history-search key.
- **`Kind` is optional during migration.** Existing `papercamp/plans.md` entries have no `Kind`/ID today; they should render with no ID badge rather than forcing a backfill pass before this can ship. New plans get a `Kind` going forward (prompted at creation, alongside the existing `Status`/`Tags`).
- **Where `Kind` is set:** at creation time only (the "Add idea" modal / `POST /api/plans`), same lifecycle moment as the ID assignment — not editable after the fact, since changing a plan's type after its ID was already referenced in commit history would make that history lie.

---

### IDEA-7: Commit section in The Stack — stage, write, and commit without leaving the dashboard

A second top-of-panel section in the Stack panel (`src/app/components/stack-panel.tsx`), sitting right below "Status" (see the "Repo health status" idea above — final order ends up Status → Commit → Active → Live). Shows the live working-tree diff — how many files changed and which ones — plus a small form to write a commit title/message and fire it off, so a commit doesn't require switching to a terminal.

This pairs naturally with two ideas already in this file: it's fed by the same file-watcher/SSE plumbing "Status" needs, and it's the natural place to cash in the `Kind`/ID scheme from "Plan & phase IDs" — pre-filling the commit's conventional-commit type from whatever plan is currently in focus.

**Look:** a changed-files count (`"7 files changed"`) as the section's headline, expanding via the same paper-ui `Accordion` the phase-description idea above needs to be built anyway — each row showing a path and its git status letter (`M`/`A`/`D`/`??`) with a checkbox to include/exclude it from the commit. Below that, a title `Input` and a message `Textarea`, then a `Button` labeled "Commit", disabled whenever zero files are checked or the title is empty.

**Feature ideas, roughly in build order:**

- **`GET /api/git/status`** — new route in `src/app/server/api.ts` that runs `git status --porcelain=v1` from the repo root and parses it into `{ path: string, status: string }[]`. Pushed over the existing `/api/activity/stream` SSE channel on the same debounced file-watcher trigger the "Status" idea already needs — "files changed" is exactly the signal that watcher is already positioned to recompute.
- **`POST /api/git/commit`** — body `{ files: string[], title: string, message?: string }`. Runs `git add -- <files>` against *only* the explicit paths in the request (never a blanket `git add -A`/`-u`) — same "write path only accepts an allowlisted/explicit set, never an arbitrary blob" principle the Settings idea's config-save endpoint already follows — then `git commit -m "<title>" -m "<message>"`.
- **Real git hooks fire for free** — since the commit happens as an actual `git commit` subprocess (not a reimplementation), a `commit-msg` hook from commitlint+husky (once the previous idea's commitlint piece lands) rejects a malformed message exactly as it would from the terminal — surfaced back to the UI as an inline `Alert` with the hook's own error text, no client-side validation logic to keep in sync with it.
- **Smart pre-fill from the active plan** — if `findFocusPlan` resolves a single in-progress plan, pre-fill the title field with that plan's `Kind` as a conventional-commit prefix (`feat: `, `fix: `) and offer a one-click "add `Refs: FEAT-2`" footer — turning the ID scheme from the previous idea into something that actually shows up in `git log`, not just in `plans.md`.

**Decisions worth making explicit:**

- **Commit only — no Push button, on purpose.** Committing is local and reversible; pushing touches shared/remote state and shouldn't be one click away in a panel that's open by default on every page. If push ever gets added, it should be its own deliberate, separately-confirmed action, not a checkbox on this form.
- **Don't hard-block commits when "Status" is red.** Failing tests/lint shouldn't disable the Commit button outright — plenty of legitimate commits are WIP or a deliberate checkpoint mid-fix. Show a non-blocking `Alert` next to the button when Status is failing (same spirit as GitHub showing a failing-check badge without blocking the merge button by default), rather than this panel unilaterally deciding what counts as "clean enough to commit."
- **Same localhost/repo-root boundary as every other child-process-spawning idea in this panel** — `git status`/`git add`/`git commit` always run against the fixed project root the dev server already knows, never a path from the request.

### IDEA-8: Ideas board — Planned/Done columns, priority order, short titles, and idea↔plan links

Today every `ideas.md` section renders flat in a single "Ideas" grid (`list-view.tsx`'s `ideaEntries.map(...)` → `IdeaCard`), as a long, un-prioritized, un-titled blob of prose per card. Nothing distinguishes a brand-new idea from one that shipped months ago, nothing says which one matters more, and the card title is whatever the first line of prose happens to be — for several of the entries already in this file, that's a full sentence. This replaces the flat grid with a real two-column board: **Planned** and **Done**.

**Idea entries need real structure, the same way plans/decisions/open-questions already have it.** Right now `ideas.md` is parsed client-side by a one-off `parseIdeas` in `src/app/stores/app-store.ts`, splitting on `---` and grabbing the first heading line as `title` — it's the only one of the four `papercamp/` files not going through the shared `src/core/parser.ts`/`src/types/index.ts` layer. This is the moment to fix that: give ideas a real `IdeaEntry` type (`id`, `title`, `body`) and a `parseIdeas` in `core/parser.ts` alongside `parseDecisions`/`parseOpenQuestions`, parsing a heading shaped `### IDEA-7: Short title` (the `IDEA-N` prefix from the "Plan & phase IDs" idea above, now load-bearing rather than decorative).

**Short titles, same rule as plans:** the heading becomes a true short title (3–6 words), not the current sentence-length headings — several already in this file need a rewrite pass once this lands (e.g. "Repo health status — live lint/format/test results in The Stack" → "Repo health status"). Whatever context that's lost from the long heading already lives in the body prose below it; nothing new needs writing, just trimming the heading.

**Priority is positional, not a stored number.** No `**Priority:** 3` field gets added — that would be one more piece of state to keep in sync by hand. Priority *is* the order ideas appear in `ideas.md`, top to bottom; reordering priority means reordering the sections in the file. The board shows ideas within each column in that same source order (highest priority first), optionally with a small rank number for readability, but the number is read off position, never set independently of it. A "move up"/"move down" control (swapping two adjacent sections' order in the file via a small write endpoint) is a fine v2 — v1 can ship fully read-only, since reordering by hand-editing the file works today and isn't blocked on any UI.

**Planned vs. Done, derived exactly as the previous version of this idea specified:** an idea is "Done" only when *every* plan linking to it (via the plan's `**Idea:** IDEA-7` field) has `Status: done` or `dropped` — checking all linked plans, not just one, so a partially-realized idea stays in "Planned." Everything else (including ideas with zero linked plans yet) is "Planned." Still nothing stored on the idea side for this — same "derive, don't duplicate" reasoning as before.

**Idea ↔ plan linking is asymmetric, matching how the data actually works:** a plan has exactly one `Idea` field (a plan grows out of at most one idea), but an idea can have many plans pointing at it (one idea, several plans built against it over time) — this is already the natural shape once the plan side stores the link and the idea side only ever derives its plans by scanning for matches, no change needed to make the cardinality work, just confirming it. Each idea row, when expanded, lists every plan that links to it as a clickable `Stamp` per plan ID (`FEAT-2`, `FIX-9`, ...) — the same plan→idea link already proposed, just rendered from the other direction.

**Look:** two columns side by side, reusing `kanban-column.tsx`'s column shell from the existing Board view (`board-view.tsx`) rather than inventing new column chrome — header + count, vertical list of rows. Each row: a small icon (the existing `LightbulbIcon` for "Planned", a checkmark icon for "Done"), the short title, and — on expand/click — the list of linked plan `Stamp`s described above. This sits where the current "Ideas" grid section lives in `list-view.tsx`, or could reasonably become its own small view if the two-column layout doesn't fit naturally inside the existing list/board toggle.

**Decisions worth making explicit:**

- **Hard dependency on the Idea-ID backlink field** from "Plan & phase IDs" above — none of Planned/Done, priority order, or the plan-link list work without it; don't start this before that field exists.
- **Migrating existing ideas.md entries** — the file's five current entries (as of this session) need a one-time pass to add `IDEA-N:` prefixes and shorten their headings; not a blocking schema migration (old unprefixed headings can render with no ID badge), but worth doing in the same pass so the board doesn't launch with half its cards missing IDs.
- **Read-only priority for v1** — explicitly deferring drag-to-reorder/up-down controls until the simpler "priority = file order" version proves the column layout itself is right.

### IDEA-9: Review status — a manual gate before "done," a fixed Closed section, and a per-plan Log

Two real gaps found while reading `plan-detail.tsx` and `closed-section.tsx` just now, both pointing at the same underlying problem: once a plan is marked complete, you lose visibility into it.

- `plan-detail.tsx`'s `handleMarkDone` jumps straight from "all phases checked" to `Status: done` — there's no human checkpoint in between. The "Mark complete" button fires the instant `allDone` is true.
- `closed-section.tsx` renders closed/dropped plans with `<PlanCard plan={p} />` and **no `onOpen` prop** — `PlanCard` only renders its "Open" button `if (onOpen)`, and the card's outer `div` has no click handler either (unlike `IdeaCard`, which does). So a closed plan in list view is genuinely unopenable today — confirmed by reading the component, not a guess.

**A new `review` status closes the first gap:** `PlanStatus` gains `review`, sitting between `in-progress` and `done`. The transition into it is automatic, not a button: `handleTogglePhase` already recomputes `allDone` on every toggle — when checking a phase makes it true, the same call sets `status: 'review'` instead of leaving it `in-progress`, no separate "Submit for review" click required. The "Mark complete" button disappears entirely; completing the last phase *is* the submission. A plan in `review` gets two manual outcomes: **"Approve & close"** (`status: 'done'`) or **"Needs changes"** (`status: 'in-progress'`, sent back — and since phases are already all checked at that point, reopening one of them is what naturally drops `allDone` back to `false`, so there's no separate "uncheck everything" step). Phase checkmarks otherwise survive every transition untouched — whatever's wrong belongs in the Log (below), not in mass-unchecking boxes.

**Where it lives in the layout — no new route.** `review` is just another `PlanStatus`, so it slots into the views that already exist rather than needing a dedicated page: one more column in the Board view (`KANBAN_COLUMNS` in `plans/constants.ts` already drives columns from a plain array — inserting `review` between `in-progress` and `done` is a one-line change) and one more section in List view (between "In progress" and "Backlog"). The plan's own detail view — already the single place phases/body/progress render — becomes the review screen simply by virtue of being opened while `status === 'review'`, enhanced with the Log section below. This avoids a second page that has to stay in sync with the same plan data it would just be filtering. If a cross-plan "waiting on my review" queue turns out to be genuinely wanted later, that's a thin filtered view addable on top of this without restructuring anything — a reasonable fallback, not the starting design.

**Fix `closed-section.tsx`:** pass the same `onOpen` prop `list-view.tsx` already wires up for the active/backlog `PlanCard`s. This alone restores the ability to open a closed or dropped plan and read what's in it — independent of everything else in this idea, and worth doing regardless.

**A per-plan Log, available on every plan, not just ones in review:** a new `### Log` sub-section in the plan's markdown block, parsed the same way `### Phases` already is — extending `src/core/parser.ts`'s existing heading-block extraction rather than writing a second one-off parser for it — formatted as dated bullets that deliberately mirror `progress.md`'s own `## YYYY-MM-DD` / `- item` shape, just scoped to one plan instead of the whole project:
```
### IDEA-10: Log
- 2026-06-21: Implemented the persistent ID counter in `.paper-camp/config.json`.
- 2026-06-22: Review — counter logic looks solid; one missing migration note, fixed.
```
Rendered in `plan-detail.tsx` below the phases list, with a small `Textarea` + "Add entry" button appending a new dated line via a `PATCH /api/plans` extension. No second write target needed for the Stack panel's "Live" feed either — it already narrates diffs between the previous and current parsed `plans.md`, so a new Log line shows up there automatically the same way a checked-off phase already does, with zero new plumbing.

**Decisions worth making explicit:**

- **Phase checkmarks survive "Needs changes."** Reopening a plan doesn't reset progress — what needs fixing gets written as a new Log entry, not represented by un-ticking a box that was honestly completed.
- **Log entries are manual-only for v1.** An AI agent appending its own checkpoints there instead of (or alongside) `progress.md` is a natural extension once the "Agent orchestration" idea's "write checkpoints as you go" convention exists, but isn't required to ship this.
