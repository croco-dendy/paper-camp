`papercamp/about.md` is the project's canonical internal reference — "the concrete shape of the system: folders, files, commands, and stack" — but it now contradicts itself after the FEAT-24 per-file migration. A new `## Per-file plan/idea storage architecture` section was bolted on while the rest of the doc still describes monolithic `plans.md`/`ideas.md` as the source of truth. Several specific sections (file table, CLI table, parser/serializer descriptions, dashboard reading model, schema sections, and a filename-case claim) describe the old layout. This plan audits each stale point against the actual code and rewrites the doc so it tells one consistent storage story, folding the scattered monolithic descriptions into/under the existing per-file section rather than leaving two parallel accounts.

### Phases
- [x] Audit stale sections against source code
      Read `src/core/scaffold.ts`, `parser.ts`, `serializer.ts`, `src/cli/index.ts`, and `src/app/server/api.ts` to confirm current reality for each flagged area before editing — the doc has drifted before, so verify rather than assume.
- [x] Fix file table and intro references
      Update the file table (~196–197) to remove `ideas.md`/`plans.md` and replace with `papercamp/plans/` and `papercamp/ideas/` dirs. Fix line 3 (philosophy pointer) and line 175 (FEAT-24 reference) that still point at the removed files.
- [x] Rewrite storage schema sections
      Collapse or redirect the `### ideas.md` / `### plans.md` schema sections (~229, ~233) and the "How structure is added" block (~214). Describe the per-file YAML frontmatter shape as the primary path; note that `decisions.md`/`open-questions.md`/`progress.md` remain monolithic and explain why.
- [x] Update CLI command descriptions
      Correct the CLI table entries for `init` (~317) and `add plan` (~319): `init` scaffolds `plans/` and `ideas/` dirs (not the removed monolithic files); `add plan` writes a new `plans/<ID>.md` file.
- [x] Update parser/serializer descriptions
      Rewrite ~329–330 to name `parsePlanFile`/`parseIdeaFile`, `readAllPlanFiles`, `readPlansMerged`/`readIdeasMerged`, and `formatPlanFile`/`formatIdeaFile` as the primary path, with the monolithic parsers noted only as back-compat fallbacks.
- [x] Fix dashboard reading model and filename case
      Update the dashboard section (~393–394) to reference per-file sources. Fix the filename-case inconsistency in the per-file section itself: use uppercase IDs (`FEAT-24.md`, `IDEA-20.md`) to match what the migration actually produced.
