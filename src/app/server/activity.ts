/**
 * Live-refresh notifier over SSE. Watches the whole papercamp/ directory and
 * pushes a tick whenever anything under it changes, so connected dashboards
 * refetch.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT synthesize a human-readable activity feed: the only
 * consumer (stack-panel.tsx) ignores the event payload and treats every tick as
 * a generic "something changed, reload everything" signal. Watching the
 * directory recursively covers the per-file `plans/` and `ideas/` trees (incl.
 * `plans/archive/`) as well as the monolithic `decisions.md`,
 * `open-questions.md`, and `progress.md` — replacing the old hardcoded list that
 * still pointed at the removed legacy `plans.md`.
