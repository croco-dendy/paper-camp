Read this plan's phases and body, then inspect the current repo state.

Explicitly never touch existing lines: never reorder, check, uncheck, or rewrite anything already there, no matter how stale or redundant it looks.

If you append anything, finish with exactly one new \`### Log\` line (date: summary) describing what was found and appended.

If nothing is missing, write nothing at all — not even an empty heading or a Log line. The audit must be safe to re-run anytime without producing log spam.`;

## Plan record shape (papercamp/about.md)

Each plan is a \`## <Title>\` heading (a short verb-led headline, 2-6 words) followed by \`**Field:** value\` lines, a free-prose body paragraph, then an optional \`### Phases\` checklist:

\`\`\`
## <Short headline>

**Status:** idea
**Kind:** feat | fix | chore | docs | refactor
**Id:** <KIND>-<N>
**Idea:** ${idea.id ?? 'IDEA-N'}
**Created:** <today, YYYY-MM-DD>
**Tags:** comma, separated

One or two paragraphs of free prose giving context — what this is and why,
in the same voice as the existing entries in plans.md.

### Phases
- [ ] Short phase title
      Optional indented long-form description of the phase.
\`\`\`

- \`Kind\` picks the ID prefix — choose whichever Conventional Commits type
  best fits this idea (most are \`feat\`).
- \`Id\` must come from the persistent per-kind counter in
  \`.paper-camp/config.json\`'s \`nextId\` field — read the current value for
  your chosen \`Kind\` (e.g. \`nextId.feat\`), use it as \`<KIND>-<N>\`, and
  increment that counter in the same write. Never derive the number by
  scanning plans.md for the highest existing one — a deleted plan's number
  must never be reused.
- \`Idea\` must be exactly \`${idea.id ?? "this idea's id"}\` — that backlink is
  what the rest of the dashboard (and this task's own success check) uses to
  find the plan you wrote.
- Write \`Status: idea\`, never anything further along. Per
  papercamp/decisions.md ("Plan-drafting agent writes plans.md directly,
  same as phase execution"), this entry lands straight in the Backlog with
  no separate approval step — a human reviews and promotes it from there,
  the same as any other backlog entry.
- Phases should be genuinely actionable steps a future agent or human could
  pick up one at a time — match the granularity of the existing phases shown
  below, not a single giant phase.

## Every other open (non-done) plan, for priority/ordering context

${plansContext}

## Where to insert it

Plan priority is file order in papercamp/plans.md — earlier means higher
priority. Compare this idea's scope and urgency against every plan listed
above and insert your new \`## Heading\` block at the file position that
actually reflects where it belongs, not appended at the end by default.

If the right position means an existing plan should now sit before or after
where it currently sits, you may move that plan's whole heading block to its
new position — but you must never edit its title, phases, or body while
doing so; a moved block must be byte-for-byte identical content, just
relocated. Do not touch any other plan's content for any other reason.`;
